## Code Style

### TypeScript/JavaScript

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Use Prettier for formatting
- Use ESLint for linting
- Prefer `const` over `let`
- Use descriptive variable names
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs

```typescript
/**
 * Updates the media metadata displayed in system controls
 * @param metadata The media metadata to display
 * @throws {Error} When metadata is invalid
 */
async updateMetadata(metadata: MediaMetadata): Promise<void> {
  // Implementation
}
```

### Native Code (iOS/Android)

**Swift (iOS):**
- Use Swift 5.9+ features
- Follow Swift API Design Guidelines
- Use proper memory management (weak references)
- Handle errors appropriately
- Add comprehensive documentation

**Kotlin (Android):**  
- Use Kotlin coroutines appropriately
- Follow Android development best practices
- Handle memory leaks prevention
- Use proper lifecycle management
- Thread-safe operations

### Commit Messages

Use conventional commits format:

```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding/updating tests

```

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run TypeScript tests
npm run test:ts

# Run linting
npm run lint

# Run type checking

```

### Writing Tests

- Add unit tests for new functions
- Add integration tests for complex features
- Test both iOS and Android when applicable
- Mock external dependencies appropriately

### Manual Testing

Test on real devices when possible:

1. **Basic functionality** - All core features work
