# Expo Media Control - Critical Issues Report

## ðŸš¨ High Priority Issues

### Android (ExpoMediaControlModule.kt)

1. **Memory Leaks & Resource Management**
   - `GlobalScope.launch` is used instead of proper scope management
   - MediaSession not properly released in all error scenarios
   - Audio focus request objects not cleaned up

2. **Thread Safety Issues**
   - `ConcurrentHashMap` used but individual operations aren't atomic
   - Race conditions in notification updates
   - Unsafe bitmap operations across threads

3. **Error Handling**
   - Exception swallowing in lazy properties
   - Missing null checks for context operations
   - Inconsistent error propagation

4. **Android Best Practices Violations**
   - Using deprecated audio focus methods alongside new ones
   - Missing proper lifecycle management
   - Notification actions disabled due to PendingIntent issues

### iOS (ExpoMediaControlModule.swift)

1. **Event Handling Issues**
   - `sendEvent` method called but not properly implemented
   - Missing proper event emission for Expo modules
   - Weak references may lead to dropped events

2. **Audio Session Management**
   - Error handling for OSStatus -50 is ad-hoc
   - Potential conflicts with other audio sessions
   - Missing cleanup on disable

3. **Memory Management**
   - Potential retain cycles in closures
   - Image loading not properly scoped

### TypeScript/JavaScript Issues

1. **Type Safety**
   - Missing runtime type validation
   - Inconsistent promise handling
   - Event listener cleanup not guaranteed

2. **API Design Issues**
   - Manual event listener management is error-prone
   - Missing proper error types
   - No validation for metadata fields

### Configuration Issues

1. **Android Manifest**
   - Empty manifest file missing required permissions and service declarations
   - Missing foreground service declaration for media controls

2. **Plugin Configuration**
   - Missing validation for configuration options
   - No error handling for invalid permissions

## ðŸ”§ Recommended Fixes

### Immediate Fixes Required
1. Fix event emission in iOS module
2. Add proper permissions to Android manifest
3. Implement proper resource cleanup
4. Fix thread safety issues
5. Add proper error types and handling

### Code Quality Improvements
1. Replace GlobalScope with proper coroutine scopes
2. Add comprehensive input validation
3. Implement proper lifecycle management
4. Add memory leak detection
5. Improve error messages and debugging

### Testing Requirements
1. Unit tests for core functionality
2. Integration tests for platform-specific features
3. Memory leak testing
4. Performance testing under load
5. Cross-platform compatibility testing
