# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### 🔧 Changed
- **Configuration Cleanup** - Removed redundant configuration options for clearer API
  - Removed `skipInterval` from plugin config (build-time) - now only configurable at runtime via `enableMediaControls()`
  - Removed unused `notificationChannel` from plugin config
  - Removed `android.requestAudioFocus` option - audio focus should be managed by media player, not control UI

### 🗑️ Removed
- **Dead Code Elimination** - Removed ~330 lines of unused/unimplemented code for better maintainability
  - Removed audio focus management code (~150 lines) - this is a control UI module, not a media player
  - Removed unused helper methods: `getPlaybackActions()`, `getSkipInterval()`, artwork loading methods (~130 lines)
  - Removed unused imports: `Bitmap`, `BitmapFactory`, `URL`, `PlaybackStateCompat` (partial)
  - Removed `addAudioInterruptionListener()` API (~50 lines) - was declared but never implemented, misleading to users
  - Removed `AudioInterruption` interface and related types
  
### 📚 Documentation
- Clarified that audio focus and interruption handling should be done by media player (expo-audio, react-native-video, etc.)
- Removed misleading API documentation for unimplemented `addAudioInterruptionListener()`
- Updated README to distinguish between build-time (plugin) and runtime (enableMediaControls) configuration
- Improved documentation for configuration options and their purposes
- Removed "Audio Interruption Handling" from feature list

### 🎯 Architecture
- **Clearer Separation of Concerns** - Module now focuses solely on media control UI, not playback logic
- **Reduced from 828 to 687 lines** in main Android module (17% reduction)
- **More maintainable** - Less code to maintain, clearer responsibilities
